# Hopfion-VR

This will be made into a final build, but the source code is here.

Make local version in Unity

When making a local version of the program with Unity, make sure that you have an editor setup so that the scripts can be opened when working with the source code. I have been using Microsoft Visual Studio which connects with the Unity project if it is set as the Unity editor. (If no editor is set, this will cause problems). I think it is also necessary to have a personal Unity account so as to manage plug-ins (particularly SteamVR)

Begin by creating a new Unity project using the 3D template. Download the github repository as a zip file to your local machine. Unzip the local repository files and copy then over to the new Unity project directory. This will install the SteamVR plug-in automatically and configure the controls. It might take some time to process after the files are copied, especially if the project is currently open. Once all the files have been configured the program should be complete functional. Have fun!

Currently the field being visualized by the arrows and particle trails must be hardcoded into the FieldScript and TestParticleScript. Right now, the hopfion field is given by the vector field given in the supplementary information of the Nature Materials SI for https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat4826 (the m field)

The default simulation scene have the vector field represented by a cube with side length of 2 units and arrow resolution of 20 per dimension. This gives a dense field of vector arrows, but its can be changed in the Unity inspector through the field object by adjusting the grid resolution value (you may have to pause the scene, change the value, then restart the scene)
